This is a simple example of combining HTML, CSS, and JS into a simple website and using ScrollReveal to make it more dynamic. 
Thanks to WEB DESIGN MASTERY for helping me in the process of creating this website. 
This website uses HTML5, CSS (Native), Javascript (Native) and ScrollReveal technologies.
The images on this website are from Mapala's "Wanaprastha Dharma" Facebook page, and I borrowed and used them.
